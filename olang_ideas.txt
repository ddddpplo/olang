'ref' keyword used as such:

ref Object object = new Object(foo);

that object was just allocated on the heap and is now treated similarly
to how C# treats refrences to objects. Its member variables and methods
can still be accessed directly with the '.' operator, no '->' operator.

object = new Object(bar);

When it's redefined, its old value will check if it has any references to it
left, and if not, it will be deleted.


Parse tree structure:

int
    foo
=
    foo
    5
if
    <
        foo
        6
    do // not a keyword but this just represents a scope
        print
            foo
        exit
            0
    else
        print
            "foo is not less than 6"
        exit
            1 // generic error exit code
